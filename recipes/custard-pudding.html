        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This simple recipe makes the most amazing custard. It thickens as it cools. In some countries, cornstarch is called corn flour. My (American) cornstarch has a very fine powdery texture, resembling powdered sugar. - Jenny Jones</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1/2 cup sugar (works with 1/3 cup)</li>
