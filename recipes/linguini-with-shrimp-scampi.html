        <em><h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Ina Garten's Linguine with Shrimp Scampi calls for lemon juice and lemon zest, and she even tops the dish with lemon slices. Follow her lead and cook the pasta in the garlicky, lemony sauce for just a few minutes before serving to allow the pasta to really absorb the flavor.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Vegetable oil</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt plus 1 1/2 teaspoons</li>
                <li>3/4 pound linguine</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
                <li>2 1/2 tablespoons good olive oil</li>
                <li>1 1/2 tablespoons minced garlic (4 cloves)</li>
                <li>1 pound large shrimp (about 16 shrimp), peeled and deveined</li>
                <li> 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1/3 cup chopped fresh parsley leaves</li>
                <li>1/2 lemon, zest grated</li>
                <li>1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice (2 lemons)</li>
                <li>1/4 lemon, thinly sliced in half rounds</li>
                <li>1/8 teaspoon hot red pepper flakes</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Drizzle some oil in a large pot of boiling salted water, add 1 tablespoon of salt and the linguine, and cook for 7 to 10 minutes, or according to the directions on the package.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, in another large (12-inch), heavy-bottomed pan, melt the butter and olive oil over medium-low heat. Add the garlic. Saute for 1 minute. Be careful, the garlic burns easily! Add the shrimp, 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt, and the pepper and saute until the shrimp have just turned pink, about 5 minutes, stirring often. Remove from the heat, add the parsley, lemon zest, lemon juice, lemon slices, and red pepper flakes. Toss to combine.</li>
                <li>When the pasta is done, drain the cooked linguine and then put it back in the pot. Immediately add the shrimp and sauce, toss well, and serve.</li>
            </ol>
