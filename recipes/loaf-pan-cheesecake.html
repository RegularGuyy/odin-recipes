        <em><h2>Description</h2>
            <p>When you want a rich and delicious homemade cheesecake for just a handful of people, it’s time to reach for your loaf pan. Our classic New York cheesecake is just as creamy and satisfying as larger models but clocks in at a manageable 6 to 8 servings and is super-easy to slice and store. A bright mix of juicy macerated berries is the perfect finishing touch.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <h3>Crust:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>3/4 cup graham cracker crumbs (see Cook’s Note)</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Cheesecake:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Two 8-ounce packages cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
                    <li>1 cup sugar</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup sour cream, at room temperature</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract</li>
                    <li>2 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Macerated Berries</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 1/2 cups (about 1/2 pound) mixed berries</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
                </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Line the bottom and sides of a 9-by-5-inch loaf pan with parchment paper, leaving a 2-inch overhang on all sides (this will help you remove the cheesecake later).</li>
                    <li>For the crust: Combine the graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, sugar and salt in a medium bowl and stir until you have a sandy mixture that sticks together when pressed. Press the crust into the loaf pan so that it evenly covers the bottom. Bake until light golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Set aside to cool.</li>
                    <li>For the cheesecake: Beat the cream cheese and sugar together in a stand mixer on medium speed for 1 minute. Add the sour cream and vanilla and mix until just combined. Mix in the eggs by hand, one at a time, until just combined. Pour the batter evenly over the baked crust.</li>
                    <li>Place the loaf pan in a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Pour enough boiling water into the dish so it comes halfway up the sides of the loaf pan. Carefully place the dish in the oven and bake until the outside of the cake is set but the middle is still slightly loose, about 1 hour 10 minutes. Turn off the oven and leave the cheesecake inside for another 45 minutes. Remove the loaf pan from the roasting pan and place it on a wire rack to cool to room temperature. Cover and refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 8 hours.</li>
                    <li>For the macerated berries: Place the berries in a medium bowl. Add the sugar and lemon juice and gently toss. Allow to sit at room temperature until the berries begin to soften and release some juice, about 1 hour and up to 2 hours.</li>
                    <li>Using the parchment paper, carefully lift the cake from the pan. Remove the parchment and place the cake on a serving platter. Top with the berries and serve.</li>
                </ol>
