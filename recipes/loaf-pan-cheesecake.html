        <em><h2>Description</h2>
            <p>When you want a rich and delicious homemade cheesecake for just a handful of people, itâ€™s time to reach for your loaf pan. Our classic New York cheesecake is just as creamy and satisfying as larger models but clocks in at a manageable 6 to 8 servings and is super-easy to slice and store. A bright mix of juicy macerated berries is the perfect finishing touch.</p>
